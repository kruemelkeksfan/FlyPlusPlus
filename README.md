# FlyPlusPlus
A simple flight simulation created with Unreal/C++.

## Controls
WASD - Pitch, Roll

Shift/Ctrl - Throttle

## Motivation
This project was originally written in the [Vienna Vulkan Engine](https://github.com/hlavacs/ViennaVulkanEngine).

I ported it to Unreal Engine to brush up my C++-skills and get a basic familiarity with the engine.
